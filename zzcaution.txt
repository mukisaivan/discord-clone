------thunderclient not allowed to make requests

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

Authenticate ThunderClient:

Get an authentication token from your Clerk-authenticated session.
Add this token to your ThunderClient requests in the Authorization header.


--------- 3. Make the /api/products route public:
Modify your isPublicRoute to include the products API:
javascriptCopyconst isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  "/sign-in(.*)",
  "/sign-up(.*)",
  "/api/products(.*)"
]);
However, be cautious with this approach as it would make your products API publicly accessible.
Use Clerk's API for testing:
Instead of ThunderClient, you could use Clerk's API testing tools which can handle authentication automatically.




----- 4. Conditional Authentication:
You could modify your middleware to only require authentication for certain operations:
javascriptCopyexport default clerkMiddleware((auth, request) => {
  if (!isPublicRoute(request)) {
    // Allow GET requests to /api/products without authentication
    if (request.method === "GET" && request.url.includes("/api/products")) {
      return;
    }
    auth().protect();
  }
});
This would allow unauthenticated GET requests but still protect POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.


--- 5. Environment-based Authentication:
You could disable authentication in development:
javascriptCopyexport default clerkMiddleware((auth, request) => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" && !isPublicRoute(request)) {
    auth().protect();
  }
});
This would allow all requests in development but protect routes in production.
